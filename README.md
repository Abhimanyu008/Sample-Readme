Kurento Utils for Node.js and Browsers
The Kurento Utils project contains a set of reusable components that have been found useful during the development of the WebRTC applications with Kurento.

The source code of this project can be cloned from the GitHub repository.

Installation instructions
Be sure to have installed Node.js and [Bower] in your system:

curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
sudo npm install -g bower
To install the library, it's recommended to do that from the NPM repository :

npm install kurento-utils
Alternatively, you can download the code using git and install manually its dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-utils
cd kurento-utils
npm install
Screen and window sharing depends on the privative module kurento-browser-extensions. To enable its support, you'll need to install the package dependency manually or use a getScreenConstraints function yourself on runtime. If it's not available, when trying to share the screen or a window content it will throw an exception.

Browser
To build the browser version of the library you'll only need to exec the grunt task runner and they will be generated on the dist folder. Alternatively, if you don't have it globally installed, you can run a local copy by executing

node_modules/.bin/grunt
